# Etch A Sketch Project
A retro throwback to my childhood using MS paint on Windows 92, 94, 95, 97, 99 into the 2000s and XP era... 
Etch A Sketch allows for pixelated sketching as one desires, with options to adjust the canvas size, color of the brush, canvas and border sizing.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Uses flexbox, and extensive use of DOM Manipulation to make adjustments to the the canvas and tools. Utilizes event listeners for clicks and keyboard presses. 

## Optimizations

The grid sizing initially set was causing too much drag on the program, so the overall size has been decreased for better usability.

## Lessons Learned:

Adding effective mobile event listeners proved challenging, in this format creating this sort of an website interface for mobile would be better off as a native app or just built a little bit more specifically. The challenge for making this fully responsive is still not over and can be where room for improvement can be added in the future. 

I ended up overcomplicating some parts of the logic and this project could benefit from going back in and refactoring the logic a bit for better usability.
